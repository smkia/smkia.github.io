About Me
======
I am an Assistant Professor at Tilburg University in the Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence. My research focuses on machine learning for brain data (MEG, EEG), with applications in psychiatry and precision neuroscience.

My Research
------
I specialize in normative modeling to analyze brain activity using MEG, EEG, and MRI data. This approach maps individual brain function against population-level references, offering insights into neurological and psychiatric disorders. Key areas of my work include:

- **Psychosis prognosis prediction**: using AI to improve early diagnosis and treatment outcomes  
- **Understanding brain variability**: charting brain dynamics across individuals, across the lifespan, and over daily fluctuations  
- **Federated and responsible AI in neuroimaging**: developing privacy-preserving and ethical AI models for clinical use  

Academic Background
------
I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Trento, Italy, where I developed machine learning methods for brain decoding using MEG data. I also have a Master’s in Cognitive Neuroscience and a Bachelor’s in Computer Software Engineering. My research experience includes working at Radboud University Medical Center and University Medical Center Utrecht on large-scale neuroimaging and AI projects.

Teaching & Mentorship
------
At Tilburg University, I coordinate and teach courses such as *Methods for Responsible AI* and *Data Processing Advanced*. I have supervised over 20 Master’s students and multiple Ph.D. students, mentoring them in research at the intersection of AI and neuroscience.
