About Me
======
Hello, and welcome! I am **Dr. Seyed Mostafa Kia**, a tenured **Assistant Professor** in the **Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence** at **Tilburg University**. My research focuses on **machine learning for neuroimaging**, with a strong emphasis on **Precision Neuropsychiatry**. I develop **AI-driven approaches** to better understand **brain function and mental health disorders**, aiming to make AI applications in healthcare more **accessible, fair, and safe**.

My Research
------
I specialize in **normative modeling** for analyzing **brain activity** using **MEG, EEG, and MRI** data. This research helps map individual brain function against population-level references, offering insights into **neurological and psychiatric disorders**. Some key areas of my work include:

- **Psychosis prognosis prediction** – using AI to improve early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.  
- **Understanding brain variability** – charting brain dynamics across individuals, the lifespan, and daily fluctuations.  
- **Federated and responsible AI in neuroimaging** – ensuring privacy-preserving and ethical AI models for clinical applications.  

Academic Background
------
I hold a **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from the **University of Trento, Italy**, where I explored **machine learning methods for brain decoding using MEG data**. I also have a **Master’s in Cognitive Neuroscience** and a **Bachelor’s in Computer Software Engineering**. My research experience includes working at **Radboud University Medical Center** and **University Medical Center Utrecht**, contributing to large-scale projects in neuroimaging and AI.

Teaching & Mentorship
------
At Tilburg University, I coordinate and teach courses such as **Methods for Responsible AI** and **Data Processing Advanced**. I have supervised **over 20 Master’s students** and multiple Ph.D. students, mentoring them in cutting-edge research at the intersection of AI and neuroscience.
